# ChangeBgColor
An app build using Swift to change background color


Some ideas to improve the app are:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well



App brainstroming

Few of my favourite apps are Instagram, Uber and Youtube.

There are lots of features I like about Instagram, one of which is the recent one that the color of heart is changed after we like someones post and also they keep updating and modifying existing features, even a small color changes is fascinating to see and users are attaracted to it without getting boared.

About Uber I like the driver tracing feature and the ride status sharing option with your trusted person so we can travel fearlessly.

Youtube - I could notice thtey have started recommendation of videos which are somewhat related to our search and also give us an option if we want to continue to see more videos based on our search keywords.
